# MetaHeuristique_Travelling_Salesman_Problem
A C++ implementation to try resolving the travelling salesman problem.
The travelling salesman problem (TSP for short) asks the question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization or what we call "MetaHeuristique", important in theoretical computer science and operations research.
